&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Our team was tasked with developing a venture pipeline of fintech businesses to be grown as arms of the more established company. We were tasked with everything from identifying ideas that had merit, creating plans to build technology, and developing revenue models and go to market strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-innovation-hub-trying-to-find-its-footing&quot;&gt;An Innovation Hub Trying to Find its Footing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TNB, The National Bank, had made huge strides in technology while also keeping their core products moving forward at a conservative pace. This strategy served them well, but they realized to create true innovation — from organizational culture to the tech stack — even the location of the offices needed to change to attract a different kind of talent. The bank, however, still needed to remain at arm’s length. Finlabs, a wholly-owned subsidiary, was created to focus solely on the creation of new financial products and services with the plan to have half of those spin out into separate legal entities, and the other half to go back into the bank and enrich its current offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first six months were primarily scaffolding activities: putting the right policies and procedures in place to adhere to all the regulatory requirements that go along with being owned by a financial institution. The team grew to about 15 people made primarily of designers, engineers, and operational support staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-landscape&quot;&gt;Understanding the Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping into an organization in its infancy, many of its policies and procedures were more cultural norms than anything else: “The Finlabs Way,” as the management team liked to say. Entire structures of the organization were trapped in individuals’ heads, but it didn’t take long to get a high level sense of the motivations of the team and the strategy of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug, the CTO, had an enterprise background. He worked and managed large teams of engineers at places like Google. Despite this, or maybe because of the culture at large tech firms, Doug was very connected to the startup culture. He read most of the typical start-up stomping grounds like Hacker News and StackOverFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug’s main focus was security. As a part of a large financial institute — a conservative one at that — being responsible for the security of the tech stack made him nervous. When he wasn’t overly stressed about code and data, he mostly was interested in how the team could take on a more “start-up” approach, or more accurately, a start-up culture. He constantly spoke in terms like passion and hunger. But despite his start-up mentality, his trepidation around the tech stack slowed the pace of development, which was at odds with the pressure from the bank to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren, the COO, didn’t have much experience in tech- nology or product. It seemed like the “messy” process, the ambiguity, and the spikey nature of the work made her anxious. She was quick to build full scale processes, which made sense, considering she went from the 50,000 person mothership to a 13 person satellite. Her biggest concerns were that the company wasn’t generating enough business ideas. Despite her lack of experience in technology and innovation, she was the manager for the venture arm of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After understanding the strategic interests of the leadership team, I had conversations with everyone on the venture team. The venture team was tasked with generating ideas and developing them to the point where the startup idea could be presented to the board of Finlabs for funding. This team was comprised entirely of business professionals with MBAs and finance backgrounds and felt the pressure from the entire C-suite to find the “next big thing.” The primary output of their work included Powerpoint slide decks with financial forecasts, macro-economic factors that might influence the business ideas, and potential competitive advantages against other firms in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-culture-for-idea-generation&quot;&gt;No Culture for Idea Generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked how many ideas had been developed in the 18 months the firm had been operational. They pointed me to a Box folder. I presumed there would be between 100 and 500 in various forms. In my head, ideas were cheap, and having start-up and design experience I subscribed to the “fail fast, fail often” mentality. Most of those 100 to 500 ideas would be bad, but hopefully I would find some groupings of concepts and perhaps be able to build off those as a foundation. What I found was that over the course of a year the team of three had a list of 12 ideas and no paper trail of thinking aside from lengthy PowerPoint decks that seemed to be too much tree and not enough forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked what the team’s cadence was. There didn’t seem to be any standing meetings, no deadlines, no goals, no specific project initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-new-routines--rituals&quot;&gt;Creating New Routines &amp;amp; Rituals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, organizational challenges or lack of innovation require time to re-frame the problem space. We get caught in the pattern of looking at problems as the sums of their parts. Design allows us to divide problems and their solution spaces, not just by division of a whole into a set of parts, but by viewing the problem/solution space from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way of dividing a problem/solution space creates new ways to tackle complex problems. The Wilcox Williams library of re-framing tools helps to unravel the complexity of problem spaces in new ways. Exploring several of our in-house heuristics for the challenges at Finlabs, Routines &amp;amp; Rituals seemed most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the top-of-the-funnel problem was as much a cultural problem as it was a functional one. The firm was created to generate new businesses from within. The staff was equal parts business, product, and engineering, and yet the business end was wholly responsible for generating concepts. That team would sit quietly and work in their silos, not taking advantage of what the designers or engineers could contribute. In addition, the tone of the office felt dry. People had their heads down in their laptops and the unstructured meetings focused on PowerPoint decks instead of artifacts that could spark innovation. To the CTO’s point, if this were a start-up, there would be “passion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rituals inspire. They can create a space and time where individuals seek to contribute as opposed to sitting quietly. They create a mindset that is out of the ordinary day-to-day flow of meetings, emails, and decks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to both the culture issue as well as the lack of idea generation ended up being a ritual — a party. We called it Pitch Fest. The concept was simple: each week the entire company would hear pitches from employees of new business ideas — served up with beer. The group had concerns about the quality of ideas, the amount of time it would take to realistically describe ideas in a rhetorical fashion to the rest of the company, and also what would become of the ideas afterwards? Their questions were pragmatic and I didn’t have answers to all of them, but I reassured them that building a culture of idea generation could go a long way, even if most of the ideas didn’t. And furthermore, it was important to prototype the event and iterate on it — the design way. While the company culture was risk-averse, nobody objected to giving it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Pitch Fest happened less than a week later. We engaged other parts of the organization for broader participation and audience feedback. Five new business concepts were pitched — they were fresh, daring, and still very much in their infancy. But most importantly, ev- eryone enjoyed the spirit of the event and felt energized for the first time in months. Through iteration, we also realized that two minutes for an idea with two minutes of questions felt right. We didn’t know what the next step should be but we had more new ideas in one afternoon than the team had produced in months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-cadence-and-routine&quot;&gt;Creating a Cadence and Routine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During any kind of innovative problem solving or project development, the whole solution rarely materializes in the beginning. Sometimes you don’t even know step two until you’ve finished step one. After the first Pitch Fest, we were unsure if the problem was going to be a lack of ideas, a lack of company engagement, or a lack of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, the question that arose from the client was “now what?” Management had done a great job of recruiting the COO from a large financial institution, the CEO had experience in Silicon Valley start-ups, the CTO was from Google, and the Head of Product from IDEO. The ‘now what’ was to lean on the expertise of the group but with the structure of routines and rituals that ensured ideas could lead to launched businesses with the best thinking in tech, design, management, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each week, the Idea Advocate (the employee who pitched it) would talk about the prior week’s progress and would advance the idea with one guiding question for each area: tech, business, design, and operations. The team didn’t need to have a pre-planned step two. The team needed to realize that each idea had its own unique next steps — visioning, prototyping, market analysis, user research, or a combination of those things. This was a team essentially tasked with creating the future and no pre-set plans could compete with the already rich set of values, vision, and experience from the leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months later, the team had doubled in size and received additional funding to launch three new com- panies within the year. Several other fun events have spawned out of Pitch Fest such as a company-wide competition of Microsoft Excel skills, hack-a-thons, and a makerspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitch Fest not only helped to create a meaningful ritual that fostered an open dialogue between employees, it has also become a successful recruiting and advertising event: potential hires and stakeholders from within TNB are regularly scheduled to visit the offices during Pitch Fest as it’s seen as a highlight of each week. Beyond Pitch Fest, the importance of cadence and a particular type of energy and idea expression has permeated the culture of FinLabs. Each quarter, the business team “pitches” ideas to a set of external advisors. And now, throughout the organization, PowerPoint decks that were typically informational have morphed into pitches themselves: they exhibit risk, fresh ideas, and narratives of new future states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes:&lt;/strong&gt; Internal Service Design, Operations, Project Management, Process and Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scoping&quot;&gt;Scoping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assignment was to develop a template for design projects. The client was a design firm of 35 people, and would have small teams of 2 to 5 people work projects, but there was no consistent process moving from business lead to contract through completion. A template would allow there to be a unified checklist, making sure a few tasks were always completed, no matter what the project, and it could also be a working document that the teams used to move towards completion. The first step in one of my organizational projects, after all of the contracts are signed, is scoping the project. This project was not only a complex beast of information, procedure, and people, but it also existed in a larger context, the design firm itself and branched off into HR, Sales, and Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main contact for this project, let’s call him John, walked me through what he thought I should do and who I should interview to get a better sense of the problem. John explained that the design firm was split into &lt;em&gt;Business People&lt;/em&gt;, User Centered People, and Graphics People. The Business People brought in the work, they wrote up the contracts, they had meetings with clients. Then the User Centered People put the most hours into the actual projects, which were 3 months to several years. And that whole time, the Graphics People were there helping to document every step of the process. John figured that it would be helpful if someone looked at all the steps of that process, from finding a client, to negotiating, to creating a project with a budget and milestones and due dates, and then creating a template that the Business People could follow. Being an outsider with a three month contract, it seemed like a job for someone else, but I had the full support of John and a couple other high level folks, so I started a bit of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tommy&quot;&gt;Tommy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy is the youngest of the Business People. I was probably pointed in his direction because he was low on the totem pole and noboby wanted to take billable hours away from top people. Tommy walked me through the typical project. Someone in the design firm knows someone in another company. They get to talking, and at some point realize that it might be a good idea to work together. The sales guy at the design firm starts tracking progress with this company. He starts figuring out if the project is the right size, if the design firm has the resources for it, if the firm has the skills. At some point a proposal is written up, usually by a Business Person that loosely outlines a bit of work. Then there’s a meeting with the other company’s management team and one of the Business People in the design firm where more details of the project are fleshed out. Another project proposal is written up with more detail, some User Centered People and some Graphics People get assigned to the project, and the Business Person manages the client and the team throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I felt like I had a rough sketch of the process, and wanted to learn more about the information systems that were used to track all these moving parts. The Sales Guy had a hardcore excel setup to track sales progress and expected revenue per month. Each project had a row in the spreedsheet, and each column had an amount for a month in the future. This way, the design firm could estimate how much revenue it would have per month based on project estimates. So if a project was 100,000 dollars split over 10 months, each month would be 10,000 of revenue, but there was also a probability rating to determine if the project would actually happen based on signatures and past experience with the client, and that probability rating would be multiplied by the revenue. This was a forcasting device to help the company plan. Everyone in the company with billable hours used an online tool for tracking how much work they did for each project. So there as one system for forcasting, and one system for keeping track of the present state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;/images/second-road-current.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tommy thought that if there was a project proposal template, with check boxes, that would go a long way. There already seemed to be a fair amount of tracking, but not much planning. He thought this could be a living document that would move with the project, and even suggest weekly meetings between the Business Person and the rest of the project team. A checkbox could be something like “Did you check with the head of the graphics team to make sure they have the resources to take on this project?” or “Schedule a weekly meeting with the User Centered People who are a part of the project to check on their hours and milestones”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sarah&quot;&gt;Sarah&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah was the head of the Graphic Designers. Apparently each group (Business People, User Centered People, and Graphics People) had a head, but it seemed like in some groups, this was just a sign of seniority and didn’t come with any power, just more non-billable hours and more pay. Sarah wasn’t like that though. Everyone in her group looked to her for mentorship, and she single handedly assigned designers to different projects based on experience, interest, and aptitude for learning. Sarah seemed frustarted with the way projects were run at the Design Firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphic design was an after thought. Instead of being a part of the conversation with Business People when putting together a project proposal, Sarah seemed to be relegated to putting out aesthetic fires, and could never take the time to properly plan out how people on her team were delegated to projects. If the Business People consulted her on a project while writing up the proposal, she would have a better understanding of the type of work, the amount of work, and who on her team would be most suited for the job. The Business People had no idea how much time it took to create a beautiful final report, and continually under estimated the level of effort for graphic design work. Of course this attributed to projects going over budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Sarah why she didn’t look at the excel document with revenue projections for each project coming down the line, and I infered from her attitude, it was either wrong for her to look at the numbers of the business, some cultural standard, or she didn’t understand how to read the document, or possibly that she felt she was too busy putting out fires. By this time, I started having a good idea of the timeline of projects and a few pain points within the process. It seemed like having a project template would not only codify a process, but it would also make sure the right people were involved. Instead of thinking of the document as just a list of tasks, it could be thought of as a tool to bring siloed groups of people together–a document that is for discussion and not individual use. I was getting excited, a possible solution was forming, but I still had no idea if that was the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, Sarah told me something that blew my mind. “Oh yeah, we made one of those a year ago”. She said it so matter of factly, that it took me aback. She went on to pull up some massive documents showing the stages of projects, listing groups of stakeholders to be included. The project template even suggested a weekly meeting between the design team and the Business Person, which I thought was a great idea. “Me and Frank and Tommy all spent about 3 months working on this system.” Tommy was a business guy that I had already talked to who didn’t even mention this, and Frank was a member of the user research team, and now that Sarah had run out of time, Frank was next on my list of interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;left&quot; src=&quot;/images/second-road-past.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;frank&quot;&gt;Frank&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You see all those people who have their own laptops? Well they all came into
the company when it was just a bunch of independent contractors.” Frank was
giving me the history of the company. It confused me to think of 3 people in a
company spending 3 months on a project template that nobody used. Why wasn’t it
used? Who authorized it just to let it die after hundreds of hours had been
poured into it. Frank was explaining that most of the older guys (and I do mean
guys, as there were zero women), most of the people in the business group, used to be independent contractors and really just want to do billable work and be left alone. Frank explained that since the organization was completely flat, it was hard to get people to do anything. He mentioned that there had been several attempts to get everyone on the same page in project planning, and even attempts at codifying proposals that went out to prospective clients had been dismissed. It seemed like older people had power just because they were older, and since there really weren’t any promotions or job titles built into a hierarchy, it was hard to displace that cultural power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cranking&quot;&gt;Cranking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there I was, at the bottom of the totem pole of power, with three weeks left in my contract, assigned to get everyone in the org to work projects a little better. I knew that there was a problem at the onset of projects, when a project was formed the right people were not at the table, and I knew that because of that poor planning, projects were burning faster than they should, and because no one was checking on projects, things could get really bad before anyone noticed. The hardest part for me at the time was figuring out what the final product was going to be. If you’re hired to make a website, or a chair, or a planned event you know that going in. I was brought in to make a project template of sorts, but after many conversations, and armed with the evidence that this approach had been taken before and didn’t work out so well, I was given some flex on what kind of widget to design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there seemed to be a strong culture that pushed aside attempts at structural overhead or structural anything, I decided to take advantage of this. Instead of creating something and trying to get people to follow it, I could create something that would push everyone in the org to be more open about their project process and progress. There was a system that projected the revenue of the firm, and there was a system that recorded hours. I ended up hacking together a system that combined the two. If a project was supposed to burn through 100k in four months, and after 2 months, the project had burned through 60k, then the project was burning too fast. The Business Person managing the project should know about this, the design team should adjust their hours, and the rest of the organization should try to help out in any way it could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of creating openess lead to a visual interface that showed
projected cost of each project, where the project should be (in this case,
around 50k) and where the project currently was (in this case, 60k) in a place
that couldn’t be avoided… the kitchen. Everyone went into the kitchen multiple
times a day. It was a place for informal conversation and socializing. The
concept was that if everyone in the organization new that Tommy (for example)
had a project that was 10k over-spent, Tommy would work hard to fix that, and
that the organization would do a better job of self regulation through instant
feedback. I considered the project a success in a single moment. After three
weeks of HTTP Requests and Perl code (yes, I actually coded it, and yes in Perl), I walked over to the CFO’s office and showed her a chart of every single project currently going on. She asked one question “Why is that one red?”, I answered, she set a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elliott Williams</name></author><category term="case-study" /><summary type="html">There is one situation that all designers, at least this designer, loves and fears at the same time–working for another designer.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Scaling Up</title><link href="/work/2008/08/03/scaling-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Scaling Up" /><published>2008-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/work/2008/08/03/scaling-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="/work/2008/08/03/scaling-up.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can design thinking and methods help organizations better understand their challenges and transform from the ground up?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Themes:&lt;/strong&gt; Patient Experience, Service and Organization Design, Design Research, Vision and Planning&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Our team was engaged to examine patient experience within an out- patient facility and explore opportunities for the facility to become a “model for the future of healthcare delivery.” Research informed visual models, and models aided design concepts that sought to alleviate pain-points in the experience for patients and families. This set a foundation for organizational transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;broad-scope-and-unclear-problems&quot;&gt;Broad Scope and Unclear Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BETHEL PARK, PENNSYLVANIA, eight miles south of Pittsburgh, is a middle class suburb with an aging population. UPMC South Hills, an outpatient facility that was built in the 1990s, had grown to include cardiology, endocrine surgery, gastroenterology, neurosurgery, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, primary care and internal medicine, urology, diagnostic imaging, lab services, physical therapy, and a walk-in clinic. More broadly, UPMC’s network was also expanding, opening and acquiring dozens of clinics and hospitals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began initial stakeholder interviews and toured the three story, 120,000 square foot facility. We were also briefed on prior research on patient satisfaction that had been conducted but never acted upon. The facility tour covered the building’s waiting areas, central cafe, and back-offices. Natural light entered the core of the build- ing through a central atrium. Our team photographed the interior and exterior physical plant, existing services, pathways, wayfinding systems, waiting areas, surgery and recovery rooms, staff offices, document storage, technology and tools, accessibility features, and more. Complete documentation helps design teams create accurate models and flow charts and keep them mentally “in place” while working in their own space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation began even before the initial walk- through: our team struggled to find UPMC South Hills because the exterior signage was blocked by trees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the facility itself poorly marked and obscured from the main road. When we arrived and looked for the administrator’s office, the directory had well over a hundred listed locations, none of which included the admin’s office. Overhead signage also proved unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we branched out and conducted exploratory research in as many facilities as possible, eventually choosing the surgery center as an opportunity with the highest number of patient engagements on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met Barry Hume and his wife Deborah. Barry was having knee replacement surgery and was referred to UPMC South Hills because of its proximity to their home. The Humes scheduled surgery day six weeks ahead of time and had two phone discussions with the nursing staff and received one final reminder and check- in phone call the day before surgery. They arrived at 8 AM, their first time at UPMC South Hills. To expedite patient arrival and to make them feel more welcome, the nursing staff waits outside a dedicated entrance for the surgery center and warmly refer to it as the “celebrity entrance.” Deborah left Barry with the nurse and parked their car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team shadowed Barry and Deborah. His surgery was successful and he spent the rest of the afternoon in recovery before being discharged at 5 PM. Both said they were pleased with the experience. This was echoed by many patients and family members: the experience is great. The staff makes patients feel as comfortable as possible; they check in on them in the days that follow; they express genuine care and concern for everyone’s wellbeing. These findings were also reflective in the internal surveys that our team inherited which showed an overwhelming levels of satisfaction. Three days later, the Humes brought a birthday cake for the nurse who took care of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/upmc1.png&quot; alt=&quot;service blueprint&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;research-insights-and-problem-framing&quot;&gt;Research Insights and Problem Framing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team conducted a broad spectrum of quantitative and qualitative research over four weeks: patient satisfaction surveys, check-in desk satisfaction surveys, staff surveys, mapping information flows, technology audits, unstructured interviews with patients, families, and staff, patient and staff shadowing, patient diaries, photo documentation, and more during the generative design phase like co-creation workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings were mapped onto stakeholder charts, journey maps, blueprints, OMI (observation-mean- ing-implication** charts, data graphs, and narratives that captured patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had our research at UPMC been solely analytical, only a partial picture would have emerged — patients would have been seen as broadly satisfied. Instead, by employing and synthesizing a variety of methods, deeper organizational issues were exposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Siloed offices with few staff members knowing the breadth of offerings at UPMC South Hills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients and staff alike lacked an understanding of the breath of services offered by the facility: referrals were made to patients outside of South Hills without realizing their needs could be met down the hall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A siloed organization with few staff members at South Hills understanding of corporate’s direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At South Hills, a clean, bright space but an atmo- sphere that evoked a dead mall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigation and wayfinding challenges, posing significant issues for first time and elderly visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The centrally-located cafe and sitting area was closed most of the time and the space felt too clinical for what it was trying to be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long periods of boredom for family members; little for them to engage with in waiting areas and a dreary cafe with sporadic hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information flow between offices was hindered by old tools and technology.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patients were bounced around: missing or erronous information and bad wayfinding led them to the wrong offices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The facility’s digital footprint lacked a clear listing of services offered, hours, and contact information. No brand cohesion existed across UPMC digital properties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding UPMC South Hills proved challenging for patients and families.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UPMC South Hills had little name recognition in Bethel Park or surrounding towns. Our survey showed that the majority of respondents did not know the facility existed or that outpatient surgery was an option in their community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A plurality of respondents confused UPMC South Hills for St. Clair Hospital, a competitor across the street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping-iterative-improvements&quot;&gt;Prototyping Iterative Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the issues we identified had fairly direct vectors between problem and solution. We developed low-fidelity concepts, estimated cost/benefit, and ran short experiments by changing the physical space: making a cozier cafe space, improvements in wayfin- ding, adding comforts to the waiting rooms, added calming music to ad hoc “breather spaces,” designed simpler forms, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Understanding ‘healthcare of the future’ begins with understanding people just as much as it does technology and advancements in medicine. For us, it meant leaving South Hills and integrating with the community…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs and Henry Ford are both credited with saying that users don’t know what they want — that they can only talk about iterative changes, not transfor- mative ones. While it’s true that future visioning does not come naturally for most people, it becomes much easier when participants are prompted with artifacts to generate ideas and offer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we prototyped the cafe, waiting rooms, entrances, hallways, and processes, we gathered feedback through diaries, forms, and co-creation tools like sticker blueprints and drawings. It helped our team get a quick sense of what resonated and was flexible enough for instant adjustments. Methods like these also collected new ideas from the participants themselves. It was efficient, immediate, and cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-pivot-towards-the-future&quot;&gt;A Pivot Towards the Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team was invited to meet with a corporate steering committee looking to improve experiences at their mid-size outpatient centers. Aside from addressing the poor wayfinding, brand awareness, and digital footprint, they asked us to scale up and envision how South Hills could become a “satellite facility of the future, serving as a model to others nationwide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an opportunity to reach ahead and not one that could be understood through linear, problem-solution thinking. Nor was the future going to be defined by moving furniture around. Prototyping new physical space has value in very direct ways to patients, families, and staff, but upstream work leads to more cohesive design with broader impact and cost efficiencies. The complexity is greater but so is the impact and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted another competitive analysis to understand innovative approaches to healthcare delivery around the world. At the time, “design thinking” was a relatively new term to business, and outside of Mayo Clinic we were the only ones explicitly practicing service and organization design. And we knew that whatever we learned from competition would merely inform us but not help us design models for Western Pennsylvania. Successful design solutions are suc- cessful in part because of contextuality. An idea that resonates in Rochester, Minnesota is never guaranteed to work in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania or Downtown Pittsburgh. Factors that influence the success of a design outcome: nuanced market demands, community and culture, workforce culture, staffing models, and more. Giving all solutions the broader organizational support would be crucial to a impactful change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding “healthcare of the future” begins with understanding people just as much as it does technol- ogy and advancements in medicine. For us, it meant leaving South Hills and integrating with the community, starting at a nearby mall on a Tuesday morning. The research was completely informal, unstructured, and randomly selected. We bought coffee for mall-walkers, talked with employees, and recorded their stories. No data came from it aside from the revelation that asking “what does the ‘future of healthcare’ look like to you” yields almost no tangible insights. Like product design, unless people are guided in specific ways to think about the future, they will struggle to articulate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most research methods are focused on the cusp of iterative change; far-futuring activities yield tropes of science fiction. We needed to understand latent needs but thirty years out. To complicate the research, healthcare is sensitive for people. Each participant brings their own experiences and openness may be hard for many. And lastly, thinking thirty years in the future was an entirely unreasonable proposition for the aging population of Bethel Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/upmc6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;juicers&quot; /&gt;
We employed a remapping technique to understand the values of individuals and community ethos: prompted with a set of four image cards per question, users were asked “if healthcare in the future were” one of the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;four juicers, one of the four magazines, one of the four vacation spots, one of the four cars, “which one would it be and why?” The choices they made were irrelevant to us; what mattered was their justification: “I like the green juicer because it’s personal. It’s one-at-a-time. With the industrial juicer, I would feel like just another orange.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I like the green juicer because it’s personal. It’s one-at-a-time. With the industrial juicer, I would feel like just another orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between juicers, vacations, and media, we collected hundreds of data points that spoke to desires of comfort, accessibility, brightness, efficiency, happi- ness, peace, relaxation, individuality, immediacy, and simplicity. We ran a linguistic analysis and the results helped us construct a vertical map defined by the community itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vertical map stemmed from the lack of vision for South Hills and UPMC’s many other satellite facilities. While we could continue to prototype valuable ground-level changes to influence patient experience, they needed to be part of a broader plan, a strategy, and a vision — one that balanced stakeholder perspectives and constraints, patient-centered values, and commu- nity ethos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every organization creates mission, vision, and values statements. Sometimes those are loosely tied to strategic plans. Rarely are those aspirational narratives tied to action plans, and if they are they remain high level. While they can be motivational for members of the organization, they are often times too abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework articulates the vision statement with clear principles, and goals share and ladder up to those principles. Goals and associated projects can be mapped to budgets, timelines, teams and business units, KPIs and OKRs. Operationalizing a vertical map is like enacting a budget plan — but the vertical map is a structured and action-oriented narrative instead of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With other clients, our vertical maps have adapted to unique organizational structures and needs. Multiple visions, for instance, all under a company-wide vision; strategic plans inserted between goals and principles; workstreams at the bottom with teams in place to execute. Like all good design, it responds to context, flexing to the realities. It creates order from the messiness, and legibility and clarity amidst the layers of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At UPMC, the vertical map was delivered as part of a larger comprehensive strategy and workbook that detailed project possibilities, proposed strategies, cost-benefit, research insights, and a high-level road- map for action. Success would depend on empowering people across the organization with tools, fostering the work, and iterating to make sure solutions have resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a values-driven and action-oriented profes- sion. We sought to create a healthier organization and healthier community through the patient’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary-of-process&quot;&gt;Summary of Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frame: A thorough review of existing research and initaitives; familiarization with connections and roles of business units; cross-stakeholder workshops defined the problem space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research: Extensive ethnographic research was turned into actionable models: blueprints, process maps, data graphs, narratives and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideate: We created new futures through collaborative design methods and turned those methods into concepts that could be tested and iterated upon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build: The vertical map was developed with articulated plans for actionable projects. We validated and roadmapped the projects.&lt;/li&gt;
